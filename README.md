# Machine Learning Python
This is my first machine learning in python

## Get Started
Type `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` to start the machine learning with the default data base

## Usage
You can obviously change all the main.py to have the data base you want, but be sure to respect all the syntax of data parsing like it is in the default main.py
